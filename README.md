This is a repository for my personal website. It is written in mostly plain HTML and CSS. This way I could host it directly here at Github Pages. 
Also I was wondering what kind of a website I could create with a mostly plain HTML and CSS. Here I am going to publish my CS projects and experiments. 
You can always visit the website at [romankuvshanov.github.io](https://romankuvshanov.github.io) or at [kuvshanov.me](https://kuvshanov.me/)
